But before start on it, letâ€™s try to understand what is Gatling and where can we useÂ it?</p><h3>What isÂ Gatling</h3><p>In single sentence, <a href="https://gatling.io/">Gatling</a> is a OpenSource load testing tool. Using Gatling, we can write Load test as code using Java/Scala programming language. As the tests are written as code, we can easily automate the tests invocation using CI/CD tools or we can even run on any instance havingÂ JVM.</p><h3>How can I run Gatling scenarios</h3><p>If you are using Gradle or Maven as build tools, gatling scenarios can be easily run using <strong>gatlingRun</strong> task. Itâ€™s works fine when we are running on CI/CD tools but when we want to run on some instance where build tools arenâ€™t present, it creates issue. Also, when we use build tools, build tools itself takes some time and resources to run. To avoid the above mentioned issues, we can build an executable java jar file and use the same on any instance where JRE (Java Runtime Environment) isÂ present.</p><h3>How can I build executable jar</h3><p>To be able run Gatling scenarios, we need to build <a href="https://imagej.net/develop/uber-jars#:~:text=An%20uber%2DJAR%E2%80%94also%20known%20as%20a%20fat%20JAR%20or%20JAR%20with%20dependencies%E2%80%94is%20a%20JAR%20file%20that%20contains%20not%20only%20a%20Java%20program%2C%20but%20embeds%20its%20dependencies%20as%20well.%20This%20means%20that%20the%20JAR%20functions%20as%20an%20%E2%80%9Call%2Din%2Done%E2%80%9D%20distribution%20of%20the%20software%2C%20without%20needing%20any%20other%20Java%20code">fat jar or uber jar</a>. Letâ€™s see how can we create a uberÂ jar</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ccx_ydIdCZxOVWuXgElSSw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://github.com/sumanmaity112/gatling-example/blob/main/src/gatling/java/com/suman/example/gatling/Application.java">https://github.com/sumanmaity112/gatling-example/blob/main/src/gatling/java/com/suman/example/gatling/Application.java</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8A6nqqIM1EBHwzBwgMf1SQ.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://github.com/sumanmaity112/gatling-example/blob/940f9c3f1be804e708f627368028db0f3a3dab62/build.gradle#L22-L50">https://github.com/sumanmaity112/gatling-example/blob/940f9c3f1be804e708f627368028db0f3a3dab62/build.gradle#L22-L50</a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see we have gradle task named <strong>fatjar</strong>, which copies all the dependencies along with compiled codebase to jarÂ file.</p><h3>How can I use newly createdÂ uberjar</h3><p>Once uber jar is created, we can easily run the jar on any instance having JRE installed. We can make use of following command</p><pre>java -jar build/libs/gatling-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar</pre><p>By default, this newly created jar runs all the Gatling simulations, but incase we want run specific simulation(s), thatâ€™s also can be doneÂ using</p><pre>java -jar build/libs/gatling-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar &lt;simulation name(s)&gt;</pre><h3>What are the benefits of executable Jar</h3><p>Executable jar has the following benefits</p><ul><li>It can be executed on any system/containers with Java Runtime Environment</li><li>Uses lesser resources than buildÂ tools</li><li>Startup time is relatively lesser than when build tool is used to start the simulations</li></ul><p>As you can see, Gatling as executable jar has many advantages over executing it using build tools. So, feel free to use this concept next time you are writing load test for yourÂ project.</p><p>PS: I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed it, and if youâ€™ve found it useful, please feel free to share with others or leave a comment ðŸ˜ƒ.
