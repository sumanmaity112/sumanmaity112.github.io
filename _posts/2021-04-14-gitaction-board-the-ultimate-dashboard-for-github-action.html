<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/308/1*DwbgpaEiT65r0I97kHjHCw.jpeg" /></figure><p>This is a kitchen time conversation between two developer (John and Jean) working as a developer in an ITÂ firm.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Hi Jean, how areÂ you?</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Hi John, I am good, thanks for asking. How areÂ you?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: I am also doing great. Whatâ€™s going on your project? Anything interesting?</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Yes, currently we are trying to move from Self managed to fully managed CI/CD tool. We did analysis on different tools and we found out <strong>Github Actions</strong> is the best fit for us. We are still contemplating the move! As it does not have a dashboard to monitor the status of all workflows atÂ once.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Thatâ€™s a simple question. <strong>Github Action</strong> doesnâ€™t have an in-built dashboard, where you can see status of all of your pipelines. But I know a tool called <strong>Gitaction Board</strong> which can create your pipeline information from Github Actions to <a href="https://cctray.org/v1/">CCtray</a> payload. Once it generates the CCtray payload you can use different tools like, <a href="https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen"><strong>NeverGreen</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://ccmenu.org/"><strong>CCMenu</strong></a> etc to monitor theÂ status.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Thatâ€™s great, but as you know I am working in a small team, I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be a good idea to maintain 2 different services for dashboard, one for CCtray generation and another to make it human readable dashboard.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Donâ€™t worry about that, it also has an in-built UI, which creates a nice dashboard.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Oh really, can you tell me more about it, like how can I useÂ it?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: <strong>Gitaction Board </strong>provides a simple and lightweight <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ottoopensource/gitactionboard">docker image</a>, using it you can create dashboard with in a couple ofÂ minutes.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Thatâ€™s nice, but can you tell me how can I customize it to suit my needs.? For say, in my team we are only interested if the pipeline is either in failed or in running state, we donâ€™t care about about success state. Can I do that using in-built dashboard?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yes Jean, you can do it. You can toggle it on UI usinghide-healthy queryÂ param.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Thatâ€™sÂ it?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yes, thatâ€™s it. Isnâ€™t thatÂ simple?</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Yes, itâ€™s reallyÂ simple.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Hey John, if I understood the GitHub Action concept correctly then I think this <strong>Gitaction Board</strong> internally uses GitHub APIs to fetch the data and then creates CCtray payload out of it. In that case, if a team consists of many developer and they all are using it then weâ€™ll hit the GitHub rate limit, isnâ€™tÂ it?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yes, your understanding is absolutely is correct. To mitigate this issue, <strong>Gitaction Board</strong> fetches the data from GitHub only when itâ€™s requested. Also, it has couple of configurable strategy when you are using itâ€™s in-built dashboard,</p><ul><li>Sometime we keep the dashboard open and do some other works. In such situations, by default it waits for 5 minutes and if itâ€™s idle then itâ€™ll stop polling until you reload the dashboard. This idle time can be configured using max-idle-time query parameter. In-case, you donâ€™t like this feature, you also can disable it using disable-max-idle-time queryÂ param.</li><li>Just like you can configure idle time using UI, you can also configure caching in the server side using CACHE_EXPIRES_AFTER environment variable. By default itâ€™s configured with 60Â seconds.</li></ul><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Great!! I can configure things as per my requirements. Can you tell me how can I configure my repositories?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Sure, itâ€™s simple. To configure repository, you have to assign the following environment variables,</p><ul><li>You have to set REPO_OWNER_NAME which is usually your github username or your organisation name (if you want monitor repos of a organisation).</li><li>Also, you have to set REPO_NAMES, which will hold the repositories names you want toÂ monitor.</li></ul><p><strong>Jean</strong>: As you know I am working on client project and we use private github repository, can this tool be used in this scenario?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yes, you can use it for private repositories as well. Again, you have to set the following environment variables,</p><ul><li>You have to set GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN so that <strong>Gitaction Board</strong> can access your private repositories.</li><li>Also, if you are using self hosted GitHub, you have to set DOMAIN_NAME variable. By default, its <a href="https://api.github.com/">https://api.github.com</a> which is basically hostname of publicÂ GitHub.</li></ul><p><strong>Jean</strong>: All these things are really great but is it a paid tool?Â ðŸ¤”</p><p><strong>John</strong>: No no, itâ€™s a free open source tool, you can just get the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ottoopensource/gitactionboard">docker image from docker hub</a> and use it as per your need. Also, if you like you can contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/otto-de/gitactionboard">github project</a> by adding new features or improve existingÂ one.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Iâ€™ll definitely look into this tool. Thanks for sharing JohnÂ ðŸ˜„.</p><p>I hope by this time you have understood the features and easy configurations of <strong>Gitaction Board</strong>. Therefore, I hope itâ€™ll be another option to choose from while you want to monitor GitHub Action workflows.</p><p>PS: I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed it, and if youâ€™ve found it useful, please feel free to share with others or leave a comment ðŸ˜„. Also, feel free to check and contribute to theÂ tool.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2863ab7d9f16" width="1" height="1" alt="">
