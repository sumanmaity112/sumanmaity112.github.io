I create and publish blogs on Medium because it has a nice user interface, statistics, opportunities to engage with the community, and so on. But, like many other developers, I preferred to have my own website for the same purpose. However, there are two major issues: first, having a personal domain comes at a cost, and second, keeping the website and medium inÂ sync.</p><p>The first issue is easily solved by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, which offer a simple way to create a personal website for free. GitHub Pages also supports <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which allows me to create static websites from plain text. To make my own website, I followed the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">GitHub documentation</a>.</p><p>The second issue is a little more difficult to resolve because I donâ€™t want to copy and paste all of the old Medium articles on GitHub pages. That means Iâ€™ll need a framework to automatically import all of my previous Medium articles to GitHub pages. Here comes <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll import</a> to theÂ rescue.</p><h3>Import Medium articles using RSSÂ feed</h3><p>Medium has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed, and I was able to import all of my Medium articles to my Jekyll-powered website using the <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/rss/">Jekyll RSS feed importer</a>.</p><p>To use the RSS feed importer, I needed to add the following two gems to the GemfileÂ â€”</p><pre>gem &quot;jekyll-import&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 0.21.0&quot;<br>gem &quot;rss&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 0.2.9&quot;</pre><p>After making the changes listed above, run the following commands to import medium postsÂ â€”</p><pre>bundle update &amp;&amp; bundle install<br>curl https://medium.com/feed/&lt;medium username&gt; &gt; .rss.xml<br>bundle exec jekyll import rss --source .rss.xml</pre><p>After running the above commands, I was able to see all of my Medium articles on the GitHub page. However, with the default Jekyll RSS feed importer, I encountered the following issueÂ â€”</p><ul><li>Tags are not automatically imported.</li><li>There is no reference to the original mediumÂ post.</li><li>Importing RSS feeds requires a local RSSÂ file.</li></ul><p>To resolve the mentioned issues, I had to fork the original Jekyll importer repository and make the necessary changes.</p><p>To use my forked Jekyll importer, I replaced the default Jekyll import gem in Gemfile with the customÂ one.</p><pre>gem &quot;jekyll-import&quot;, git: &quot;https://github.com/sumanmaity112/jekyll-import.git&quot;</pre><p>After making the above changes, run the following commands to re-import medium postsÂ â€”</p><pre>bundle update &amp;&amp; bundle install<br>bundle exec jekyll import rss \<br>--source https://medium.com/feed/&lt;medium username&gt; \<br>--canonical_link true \<br>--extract_tags category</pre><p>All of my articles were properly imported and had the appropriate tags attached.</p><p>My articles were properly imported using the custom RSS feed importer, but I thought it was overly verbose. As a result, I created the Medium importer, which allows me to import articles simply by <em>username</em>.</p><pre>bundle exec jekyll import medium \<br>--username &lt;medium username&gt;</pre><p>The medium articles were properly imported after all of the above changes. The issue arises when a new article is published on Medium. I had to re-run the command to import the new article, which I found tedious. So I automated it with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHubÂ actions</a>.</p><h3>Automate importÂ process</h3><p>To make the process automated, I had to create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a> with <strong>code</strong> access and store it in GitHub secrets. Then include the following workflowÂ â€”</p><pre>name: &quot;Import from Medium&quot;<br>on:<br>  schedule:<br>    - cron: &#39;0 6 * * *&#39;<br>  workflow_dispatch:<br><br>jobs:<br>  import:<br>    runs-on: ubuntu-latest<br><br>    steps:<br>      - name: Checkout local repository<br>        uses: actions/checkout@v3<br>        with:<br>          fetch-depth: 0<br>          token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}<br><br>      - name: Setup Ruby<br>        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1<br>        with:<br>          ruby-version: 3<em><br>          </em>bundler-cache: true<br><br>      - name: Import blogs from medium<br>        run: bundle exec jekyll import medium --username &lt;medium username&gt;<br><br>      - name: Commit and push imported blogs<br>        run: |<br>          git add _posts<br>          if ! (git diff --staged --quiet --exit-code); then<br>              git config --global user.name &quot;GitHub Actions&quot;<br>              git commit -m &#39;Import blogs from medium&#39;<br>          fi<br>          git push origin main</pre><p>This workflow runs every day at 6 a.m. UTC, so if a new article becomes available, it will import it automatically.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>I was able to create a beautiful <a href="https://sumanmaity112.github.io/">website for myself</a> using GitHub pages and the Jekyll and Jekyll Chirpy themes.<br>If you want to look at the improved Jekyll importer code, you can find itÂ <a href="https://github.com/sumanmaity112/jekyll-import">here</a>.</p><p><em>PS: I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed it, and if youâ€™ve found it useful, please feel free to share it with others or leave a commentÂ </em>ðŸ˜„<em>.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cdf174bc674" width="1" height="1" alt="">
