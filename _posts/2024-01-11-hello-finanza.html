I am fine. Thank you for asking. How areÂ you?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: I am also doing well. Btw, why are you soÂ worried?</p><p><strong>Jean: </strong>I was browsing through my bank account and couldnâ€™t figure out where or how I spent the majority of myÂ money.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Have you not checked the transaction statement?</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Yes, I did it. The difficulty is that I pay for the majority of my costs using digital payments. As a result, the transactions were lengthy and didnâ€™t produce any benefit. So now Iâ€™m wondering how I can find out where all the money gone. BTW, have you ever been in a similar situation?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: I encountered very similar events a few weeks ago. Thatâ€™s when I went online to see if there was any tool available to make things easier. Thatâ€™s when I discovered <a href="https://sumanmaity112.github.io/finanza/#/"><strong>Finanza</strong></a>, an open-source tool hosted on a website. The application uses charts to assist users analyse financial activities.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: Oh, that is interesting. Could you please explain a little more about theÂ tool?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yes, Finanza allows you to arrange transactions based on their descriptions and/or dates. It will first provide you with a satellite view of your debit and credit transaction history. Later, you can drill down to lower-level details as needed. In addition, you will be able to view transactions alongside the charts and filter them asÂ needed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AxdfhT3RWwInob5IJhwppQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N1A3yeCMAuQt0DYFTNXmAA.png" /></figure><p><strong>Jean</strong>: That is nice. How does it collect my information? Do I have to log in or something? How does it maintain myÂ data?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Thatâ€™s the best part, you do not have to create a new account or log in anywhere. Simply download the transaction from your account and upload it to the application; thatâ€™s it. The good thing of this program is that it performs transactions within the userâ€™s browser, ensuring that data does not leave the userâ€™s system. It uses browser history to share data between pages, so if youâ€™re using a shared machine, simply clear the history to remove all of your personalÂ info.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: You pointed out that I needed to upload the transaction data; do I need to use a specific format or anything?</p><p><strong>John</strong>: It only requires the transaction details in a basic CSV format. You can find out more about the format on theÂ website.</p><p><strong>Jean</strong>: I will absolutely look at this tool. Thank you for sharing, JohnÂ ðŸ˜ƒ.</p><p>I trust that you now grasp the characteristics and advantages offered by <a href="https://sumanmaity112.github.io/finanza/"><strong>Finanza</strong></a>. As a result, I hope that if you find yourself in a position similar to the one described here, or just want to figure out the transaction pattern, <a href="https://sumanmaity112.github.io/finanza/"><strong>Finanza</strong></a> will be anÂ option.</p><p>The source code for this application is available on <a href="https://github.com/sumanmaity112/finanza">GitHub</a>.
